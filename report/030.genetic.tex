\section{Population dynamics}\label{sec:genetic}
% Why is it impossible for us to do the simulation as a deterministic population model?

\subsection{The genetic algorithm}
The population dynamics used is a simple genetic algorithm with selection an replacement but without recombination (crossover). Let $\mu$ be the population size and $P_{t} = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_\mu\}$ the population at time $t$. The individuals' \textco{evaluation} is performed in comparison to all other individuals in the population as
\begin{equation*}
f'(x_i) = \frac{\sum_{j = 1}^\mu f_{i,j}}{\sum_{i,j = 1}^\mu f_{i, j}}
\end{equation*}
where $f_{i, j}$ is the payoff according to \ref{equ:game:payoff} for $x_i$ playing against $x_j$, $f_{i,i} = 0$.


In the \textco{parent selection} phase $\nu$ individuals are chosen to be parents, and the expected number of offspring is in proportion to the individuals fitness according to\footnote{Usually one needs to normalise the expectation, but here $f$ already is relative to the payoff sum.}
\begin{equation*}
ev(x) = \nu f(x).
\end{equation*}
