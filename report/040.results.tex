\section{Results and discussion}\label{sec:results}
% Shortcomings in the MATLAB program
The \matlab\ program described in section \ref{sec:implem} has different shortcomings, mostly in performence, that makes it hard to carry out numerous demanding examinations of the game model. Nevertheless some investigations were carried out and the results are presented in this section.\mypar

% Variation of mutation rate
One thing that investigated was he mutation rate $p_{\textrm{mut}}$. In the experiments the mutation parameters was set as. 

% Interpretation of the figures

% Variation of generation gap


\subsection{Improvements}
For to start with, it appeared to be time consuming to evaluate all individuals against each other.

\subsection{Further work}
(altering the parameters in the payoff matrix would be a interesting extension of this work).
