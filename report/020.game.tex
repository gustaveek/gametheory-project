\section{The game solution}\label{sec:game}
The game described in section \ref{sec:intro:game} is never really simulated. Instead the game is seen as a Markov process, where the states are constituted of all possible histories of a length given by the memory length. A transition matrix is then generated and the distribution of states is used to appreciate the average payoff for \pone\ and \ptwo. Consider the look-up table in Figure \ref{fig:game:lookup}. There every row corresponds to a state in the Markov process, and e.i.\ \pdhifour{d}{d}{c}{d} denotes the history that both \pone\ and \ptwo\ chose \textsc{d} two rounds before and in the latest preciding round \pone\ chose \textsc{c} and \ptwo\ \textsc{d}.

The length $N$ of the table  is decided by the longest memory of the two players according to
\begin{equation*}
N = 2\cdot\ceil{\frac{\max(M_\pone, M_\ptwo)}{2}}.
\end{equation*}
% Observe double usage of M here. This is a general problem in the presentation so far.

\subsection{The Transition Matrix}
The \textsc{pd} can be seen as the dynamic system
\begin{equation*}
h_{t+1} = M\, h_t
\end{equation*}
where $h_t$ is the state probability distribution at time $t$ and $M_{N\times N}= \{ m_{i,j}\}$ the transition matrix. The elements $m_{i, j}$ of $M$ thus corresponds to the probability for transition $j\rightarrow i$. The elements $m_{i, j}$ of $M$ are calculated in the following way.

Let $S = \myfrac{1}{2}\log_2\, N$ be the depth of the matrix with regard to blocks that divide the matrix in four. Use the measures
\begin{align*}
x &= (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_S) &\textrm{where} \quad x_s &= \floor{\frac{\makebox[1ex]{\textit{i}}-1}{4^{s-1}}} \mod 4 \quad \textrm{and}\\
y &= (y_1, y_2, \dots, y_S) &\textrm{where} \quad y_s &= \floor{\frac{\makebox[1ex]{\textit{j}}-1}{4^{s-1}}} \mod 4
\end{align*}
to get the values of the matrix elements according to
\begin{equation*}
m_{i, j} = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\begin{array}{l}
A\,B\,(1-p_e)^2 + \\
(1 - A)\,B\, p_e(1-p_e) + \\
A\,(1-B)\,(1 - p_e)p_e + \\
(1-A)(1-B)\,p_e^2 \\[\baselineskip]
\end{array}
 & \textrm{if~}
\begin{array}{r@{~=~}l}
\quad y & (x_2, x_3, \dots, x_S, y_S) \textrm{~where~} \\
    y_S & 1, 2, 3, \textrm{~or~} 4
\end{array}
\\~\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}~\\
\begin{array}{l}
0
\end{array}
 & \textrm{otherwise,}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}
and here
\begin{align*}
A &= \left\{%
\begin{array}{cl}%
(1-s_j) & \textrm{if~} x_1 = 1 \textrm{~or~} 2 \\
s_j & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{array}%
\right. \\[0.5\baselineskip]
B &= \left\{%
\begin{array}{cl}%
(1-t_j) & \textrm{if~} x_1 = 1 \textrm{~or~} 3 \\
t_j & \textrm{otherwise.}%
\end{array}%
\right.%
\end{align*}

The sought steady state distribution $h^\ast$ is achieved through diagonalisation of $M$. The distribution $h^\ast$ is the normalised eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$.

The payoff $f$ for player \pone\ and \ptwo\ is then simply achieved in the following manner. First construct the state vector $g = (g_1, g_2, \dots, g_4)^\transp$ that corresponds to $M = 2$ %OBS
as
\begin{displaymath}
g_l = \sum_{\mathrm{all~} k } h_i
\end{displaymath}
where $k$ are those $i$ for which $x_i = l$. The payoffs are the given as
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l@{~=~}l}
f(\pone) & 3\, g_4 + 5\, g_2 + g_1 \\[.5\baselineskip]
f(\ptwo) & 3\, g_4 + 5\, g_3 + g_1.
\end{array}
\right.
\label{equ:game:payoff}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Construction of look-up table and strategy representation} % and construction of the look-up table
As said, the optimisation method used here is genetic algorithms. The population dynamics of the genetic algorithm is described in section \ref{sec:genetic} but at this phase the strategy encoding will be presented.

A \textit{strategy} consists of a choice of action for every possible game history. Consider again Figure \ref{fig:game:lookup}. An individual $x$'s strategy of memory length $M$ is represented as a string $c = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_2^M)$ of length $2^M$ with probabilities. The convention is corresponding to that in Figure \ref{fig:game:lookup} that the opponent's latest action is the fastest varying.

The table elements $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_N$ are simply \pone's strategy $c^{\textsc{i}}$, duplicated sufficient number of times if $2^M < N$. Regarding table elements $t_1, t_2, \dots, t_N$, \ptwo's strategy $c^{\textsc{i}}$ is permuted so that middle two quarters are shifted recursively as shown in Figure \ref{fig:game:shift}.
