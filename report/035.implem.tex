\section{Implementation} \label{sec:implem}
The model described was implemented in a \matlab program.

\red{Continue to explain the concessions taken to get the program to work.}

\red{For example the discretisation of the gene}

Both fitness proportional and exponential selection were implemented, but during the simulations presented here only fitness proportional selection were used. \red{Why?}
