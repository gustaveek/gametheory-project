% Documentation of separation of data and code

As of this moment, [2015-06-11 tor], data files, pictures, and binary
reports are all committed, mixed with the source code. This piece of
wording is about how it is separated.

The git repository *gametheory-project* is completed with a directory
*gametheory-project-datablobs* in which all binary blob files
live. Before the separation the project directory was 89M. After the
separation the directory size became 

The following pattern containing gz-, odt-, pdf-, and png-files are identified.

    find * -regex '.*\.tar\.gz\|.*\.odt\|.*\.pdf\|.*\.png\|.*\.mat'

Copy the data-files from current *master*

	b=../gametheory-project-data
	find * -regex '.*\.tar\.gz\|.*\.odt\|.*\.pdf\|.*\.png\|.*\.mat' |\
	while read p; do d="$b/${p%/*}"; mkdir -p "$d"; cp -f "$p" "$d"; done

Remove files matching the pattern from all of history using git-filter-branch

	git filter-branch --tree-filter \
      "find * -regex '.*\.tar\.gz\|.*\.odt\|.*\.pdf\|.*\.png\|.*\.mat' -delete" \
	  HEAD

Clone the repository which is safer than garbage collect. Must clone
with a full path specification: *file:///path/to/repo*, since plain
path uses hard links, which will not reduce the size.
